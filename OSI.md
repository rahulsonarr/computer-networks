The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand how different network protocols interact. It divides network communication into **seven layers**, each with distinct functions. Here's an overview of each:

### 1. **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**
   - **Function**: Deals with the physical connection between devices, including electrical, optical, or wireless transmission of raw bitstreams.
   - **Key Components**: Cables, switches, network interface cards (NICs), hubs, etc.
   - **Example Protocols**: Ethernet (physical layer aspects), USB.

### 2. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**
   - **Function**: Handles error detection, correction, and the reliable transmission of data frames between two physically connected nodes. It also defines how data is formatted for transmission.
   - **Sub-Layers**: Media Access Control (MAC) and Logical Link Control (LLC).
   - **Key Components**: Switches, Bridges.
   - **Example Protocols**: Ethernet, Wi-Fi (802.11), PPP, HDLC.

### 3. **Network Layer (Layer 3)**
   - **Function**: Manages logical addressing, routing, and packet forwarding across different networks. This layer decides the best path to send data.
   - **Key Components**: Routers.
   - **Example Protocols**: IP (Internet Protocol), ICMP, OSPF, BGP.

### 4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**
   - **Function**: Ensures end-to-end communication, error recovery, and flow control. It can be connection-oriented (TCP) or connectionless (UDP).
   - **Key Components**: Firewalls (some aspects), Gateways.
   - **Example Protocols**: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

### 5. **Session Layer (Layer 5)**
   - **Function**: Manages sessions or connections between applications, including establishing, maintaining, and terminating communication sessions.
   - **Key Components**: API, Socket Management.
   - **Example Protocols**: NetBIOS, PPTP.

### 6. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**
   - **Function**: Translates, encrypts, or compresses data so it can be properly understood and displayed to the user. It ensures that the data sent by the application layer of one system can be read by the application layer of another.
   - **Key Components**: Data translation.
   - **Example Protocols**: SSL/TLS, JPEG, MPEG, GIF.

### 7. **Application Layer (Layer 7)**
   - **Function**: Provides network services directly to end-users or applications. This is where communication between the network and the application takes place.
   - **Key Components**: Web browsers, email clients.
   - **Example Protocols**: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, POP3.

Each layer relies on the one below it to function and provides services to the layer above it. This modular approach allows for flexibility, easier troubleshooting, and standardization in network communication.
